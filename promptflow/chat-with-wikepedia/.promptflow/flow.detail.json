                  "ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.[2]. ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence.[3] By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion.[4][5] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie and Grok.[6] Microsoft launched Copilot, now based on OpenAI's GPT-4o. Some observers raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[7][8]. ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[7] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o and GPT-3.5. The ChatGPT subscriptions \"Plus\", \"Team\" and \"Enterprise\" provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation and increased GPT-4o usage limit.[9]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[10] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[11][12] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant."

                  "Since OpenAI's public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the use of chatbots have been widely discussed within education, with many in education opposing  usage of large language models, while others have described the tools as useful. The use of oral exams have been proposed to assure that such chatbots cannot be used in tests.. In a blinded test, ChatGPT was judged to have passed graduate-level exams at the University of Minnesota at the level of a C+ student and at Wharton with a B to B− grade.[1] The performance of ChatGPT for computer programming of numerical methods was assessed by a Stanford University student and faculty in March 2023 through a variety of computational mathematics examples.[2] Assessment psychologist Eka Roivainen administered a partial IQ test to ChatGPT and estimated its Verbal IQ to be 155, which would put it in the top 0.1% of test-takers.[3]. In a poll conducted in March and April 2023, 38% of American students reported they had used ChatGPT for a school assignment without teacher permission. In total, 58% of the students reported having used ChatGPT.[4][5]. A major shortcoming of ChatGPT is accuracy, as some term papers written by the large-language model contained errors. Wharton School professor Ethan Mollick noted that ChatGPT contained some \"surprising\" errors, especially in mathematics.[6]. ChatGPT's capability to write assignments for students have made it the center of intense scrutiny and censure from educators, especially with regard to essays. Some headlines for op-eds, such as one in The Atlantic, foresaw the \"death\" of the college application essay in particular thanks to ChatGPT.[7][8][9]. The impact of ChatGPT on education, especially in English studies, is indeed a topic of significant discussion."

          "ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.[2]. ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence.[3] By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion.[4][5] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie and Grok.[6] Microsoft launched Copilot, now based on OpenAI's GPT-4o. Some observers raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[7][8]. ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[7] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o and GPT-3.5. The ChatGPT subscriptions \"Plus\", \"Team\" and \"Enterprise\" provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation and increased GPT-4o usage limit.[9]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[10] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[11][12] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant."

          "Since OpenAI's public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the use of chatbots have been widely discussed within education, with many in education opposing  usage of large language models, while others have described the tools as useful. The use of oral exams have been proposed to assure that such chatbots cannot be used in tests.. In a blinded test, ChatGPT was judged to have passed graduate-level exams at the University of Minnesota at the level of a C+ student and at Wharton with a B to B− grade.[1] The performance of ChatGPT for computer programming of numerical methods was assessed by a Stanford University student and faculty in March 2023 through a variety of computational mathematics examples.[2] Assessment psychologist Eka Roivainen administered a partial IQ test to ChatGPT and estimated its Verbal IQ to be 155, which would put it in the top 0.1% of test-takers.[3]. In a poll conducted in March and April 2023, 38% of American students reported they had used ChatGPT for a school assignment without teacher permission. In total, 58% of the students reported having used ChatGPT.[4][5]. A major shortcoming of ChatGPT is accuracy, as some term papers written by the large-language model contained errors. Wharton School professor Ethan Mollick noted that ChatGPT contained some \"surprising\" errors, especially in mathematics.[6]. ChatGPT's capability to write assignments for students have made it the center of intense scrutiny and censure from educators, especially with regard to essays. Some headlines for op-eds, such as one in The Atlantic, foresaw the \"death\" of the college application essay in particular thanks to ChatGPT.[7][8][9]. The impact of ChatGPT on education, especially in English studies, is indeed a topic of significant discussion."

              "ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.[2]. ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence.[3] By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion.[4][5] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie and Grok.[6] Microsoft launched Copilot, now based on OpenAI's GPT-4o. Some observers raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[7][8]. ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[7] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o and GPT-3.5. The ChatGPT subscriptions \"Plus\", \"Team\" and \"Enterprise\" provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation and increased GPT-4o usage limit.[9]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[10] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[11][12] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant."

              "Since OpenAI's public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the use of chatbots have been widely discussed within education, with many in education opposing  usage of large language models, while others have described the tools as useful. The use of oral exams have been proposed to assure that such chatbots cannot be used in tests.. In a blinded test, ChatGPT was judged to have passed graduate-level exams at the University of Minnesota at the level of a C+ student and at Wharton with a B to B− grade.[1] The performance of ChatGPT for computer programming of numerical methods was assessed by a Stanford University student and faculty in March 2023 through a variety of computational mathematics examples.[2] Assessment psychologist Eka Roivainen administered a partial IQ test to ChatGPT and estimated its Verbal IQ to be 155, which would put it in the top 0.1% of test-takers.[3]. In a poll conducted in March and April 2023, 38% of American students reported they had used ChatGPT for a school assignment without teacher permission. In total, 58% of the students reported having used ChatGPT.[4][5]. A major shortcoming of ChatGPT is accuracy, as some term papers written by the large-language model contained errors. Wharton School professor Ethan Mollick noted that ChatGPT contained some \"surprising\" errors, especially in mathematics.[6]. ChatGPT's capability to write assignments for students have made it the center of intense scrutiny and censure from educators, especially with regard to essays. Some headlines for op-eds, such as one in The Atlantic, foresaw the \"death\" of the college application essay in particular thanks to ChatGPT.[7][8][9]. The impact of ChatGPT on education, especially in English studies, is indeed a topic of significant discussion."

        "contexts": "Content: ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.[2]. ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence.[3] By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion.[4][5] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie and Grok.[6] Microsoft launched Copilot, now based on OpenAI's GPT-4o. Some observers raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[7][8]. ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[7] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o and GPT-3.5. The ChatGPT subscriptions \"Plus\", \"Team\" and \"Enterprise\" provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation and increased GPT-4o usage limit.[9]. ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[10] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[11][12] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ChatGPT\n\nContent: Since OpenAI's public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the use of chatbots have been widely discussed within education, with many in education opposing  usage of large language models, while others have described the tools as useful. The use of oral exams have been proposed to assure that such chatbots cannot be used in tests.. In a blinded test, ChatGPT was judged to have passed graduate-level exams at the University of Minnesota at the level of a C+ student and at Wharton with a B to B− grade.[1] The performance of ChatGPT for computer programming of numerical methods was assessed by a Stanford University student and faculty in March 2023 through a variety of computational mathematics examples.[2] Assessment psychologist Eka Roivainen administered a partial IQ test to ChatGPT and estimated its Verbal IQ to be 155, which would put it in the top 0.1% of test-takers.[3]. In a poll conducted in March and April 2023, 38% of American students reported they had used ChatGPT for a school assignment without teacher permission. In total, 58% of the students reported having used ChatGPT.[4][5]. A major shortcoming of ChatGPT is accuracy, as some term papers written by the large-language model contained errors. Wharton School professor Ethan Mollick noted that ChatGPT contained some \"surprising\" errors, especially in mathematics.[6]. ChatGPT's capability to write assignments for students have made it the center of intense scrutiny and censure from educators, especially with regard to essays. Some headlines for op-eds, such as one in The Atlantic, foresaw the \"death\" of the college application essay in particular thanks to ChatGPT.[7][8][9].
