Spartacus documentation

1. About CORS
The CORS mechanism defines a way for a browser and a server to decide which cross-origin requests for restricted resources can or cannot be allowed.
2. We can run spartacus in both development and production mode 
3. Spartacus schematics allow you to install Spartacus libraries in your project. Eg, if developing schematics for Spartacus 3.0, then you should install Spartacus 2.0.
