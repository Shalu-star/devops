1. Accelator:
	if we want to craete a b2c site then we dont have to code from basics. We hav to just customize the 
existing code. This type of already developed template a/q to business req. is known as accelator.

Hybris has 4 accelators:
 
 a. B2c acc.- for eg: amazon, flipkart
 b. b2b acc.- for eg: if lenovo and Hcl work together is b2b 
 c. c2b acc.- if i hav developed some projects and u bid this project to various caompanies.
 d. c2c acc.- for eg: olx

B2c acc
Hybris has provided a template we only just ahv to customise a/q to rqquirement.
 
in B2c acc there is alredy 
Add to cart 
checkout
payment
order placement   template.

2. Extension:
  java - create project - write code similarly
  hybris- create extension - write code

In hybris for each functinality, modules we hav diff extensions.

we modularize hybris code into small java modules/projects and those modules/projects are called extension.


we can create new extensions in custom folder.
platform->extgen->build.properties  in this folder our path is declared where
extension will be created.

=>Command to create new extension: ant extgen
default template is yempty.
extension mame Hybris
package name de.hybris.training

after creating new extension we hav to add this in hybris->config->localextensions.xml file.
 then we hav to do ant clean all then in the extension ther will be classes extensioninfo.xml folder will be created.
