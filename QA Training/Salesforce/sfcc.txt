In Inventory 

This page allows you to manage all detail settings of a single product inventory record.

1. The Perpetual flag allows you to set a perpetual (unlimited) availability for the product in the Storefront.
2. Allocation represents the initial amount. Based on this value (if the "Perpetual" flag is unchecked), the system calculates the actual amount available to sell (ATS) by considering all stock-level transactions that occurred after the allocation was reset (Allocation Reset Date). If you reset the allocation, the allocation reset date will also be reset.
3. Pre-Order/Backorder Handling specifies how the Storefront behaves if there is no stock level.
4. Pre-Order/Backorder Allocation specifies how many items are available after the stock level reaches zero.
5. In-Stock Date specifies when stock will become available.
6. Turnover represents the sum of all stock-level transactions that occurred after the allocation was reset and that have been exported.
7. On Order represents the sum of all stock-level transactions that occurred but haven't been exported.
8. Stock Level specifies how many items are in stock. It's calculated as max(0, allocation - turnover - on order).
9. ATS represents the actual amount of items available to sell (ATS) in the Storefront. If "Pre-Order/Backorder Handling" is specified, then it's calculated as stock level + pre-order/backorder allocation. Otherwise it's the same as the stock level.
10. Availability Status gives information about the current availability of the product based on the current data. It's possible to have values for "In Stock", "Pre-Order", "Backorder", and "Not Available".
